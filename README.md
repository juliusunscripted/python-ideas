## Gettings started

> in case you need help for getting started: follow instructions of repo [new-python-project](https://github.com/juliusunscripted/new-python-project)


## What is the structure of this repo

- I wanted to have one git repository for different python ideas and examples I am planning to share
- you can open different subfolders with seperate topics in vscode to have a pre configured workspace. For example:
	```bash
	# clone this repo
	# cd into this repo
	# move into interactive-window
	cd interactive-window
	# setup prepared project python environment
	poetry install --compile --sync
	# you are ready to try out the examples
	# perhaps you have to reload the vscode window
	```
